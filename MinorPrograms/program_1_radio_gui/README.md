# Program 1 - Radio GUI

## Details

* September 5th
* Do problem 2.11 on page 63 of your text. Step-by-step instructions are provided for you in the text. In this
assignment, you are asked to create a GUI using controls that we have not yet discussed. The exercises give you
practice with visual programming only â€“ the programs do not perform any actions. You place controls from the
Toolbox on a Form to familiarize yourself with what each control looks like.
